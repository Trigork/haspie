Haspie is a musical harmonization and composition assistant based on Problem Solving and Constraint Logic through the use of Answer Set Programming. The tool takes scores in MusicXML format and annotates them with the best possible harmonization. If specified, it is also able to complete intentionally blank sections and create brand new parts of the score. At its current state, the tool is mostly functional, but has limitations. Despite this fact, it serves as a Proof of Concept of one of the many real world applications that Answer Set Programming can achieve to solve.
