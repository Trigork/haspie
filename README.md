Tool for harmonizing musical pieces based in Answer Set Programming

**DISCLAIMER: Haspie Haspist's name is a pun and a working title, should not be taken as final but who knows.**

# What is this?

The current project is its author's Computer Science Final Degree Project and tries to achieve automatic harmonization of melodic pieces throught the use of [Answer Set Programming](http://potassco.sourceforge.net/). It consists of two stages: Parsing and Magic. Parsing transforms a melodic musical piece in MusicXML to logic facts *a la prolog* while Magic uses several harmony rules and the previously given facts to deduce the piece's harmony and be able to write scores for other voices following it or detect mistakes and irregularities in the current melody.

Indeed, but due to time and complexity restrictions it won't cover complex aspects of composition nor harmonization. No modulation, just plain and simple harmonization.
